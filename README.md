The Video Subtitles Detector is a program designed to detect and highlight subtitles within a video. It identifies the 
area containing the subtitles by drawing bounding boxes around them and further detects the location of each word within the subtitles.
The program processes the video using basic filters and morphological operations, without relying on deep learning, machine learning, or OCR techniques.
